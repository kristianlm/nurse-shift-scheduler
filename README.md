# nurse-shift-scheduler

## Overview

Quickly enter any single-letter code for each day. For example, `N`
for night-shifts and `D` for day-shifts.

You can enter letters into a calendar:

If you press a key, that'll be the single-letter code for that
day. Easily navigate using the arrow keys. Or click on a day to move
the red cursor there. You can then export to this:

## Setup

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

    lein clean

To create a production build run:

    lein do clean, cljsbuild once min

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL.
